jump thru windows:
	should carry momentum; currently comes to complete stop when vault complete
	vaulting speed determined by linear velocity when vault starts?

rotate carry objects

swinging lights/grabbable

hide in cabinets:
	cabient has a very small step that blocks player from entering
	works while standing after crouching at least once; doesn't work while crouching:
		(is this because movement while not on the ground is cancelled?) THIS IS THE PROBELM

waiting on jacob to finish sprites for interaction display lock,unlock,light,use_key

monster:
	player detection:
		sight:
			if player within cone of vision, check player detection_level (determined by light)
			if player above light threshold (specific to monster), point raycast to player to check for collisions (update w/ timer)
			if player collider found, begin chase (enum state state.chase/pursuit/hunt?)
			if player leaves cone of vision after being spotted, begin timer (2 seconds?):
				after timer, monster loses sight and searches last known location
				search location and surrounding area, if no player, resume patrol
		sound:
			sound levels of furniture, doors, footsteps, thrown objects can attract certain monsters if above threshold

sounds:
	speed dependent:
		when walking/running/crouching (both player and monster)
		opening/slamming/locking/unlocking doors
		drawers open/close
	light buzz effect?
	monster sounds
	scary chase and ambient sounds/music

main hub room: bedroom in house
parts of house blocked off for safety
monsters can still enter other parts of house to surprise player (followed/watched player go home?)

bedroom contents:
	bed to save game
	computer for upgrades?
	pet dog/cat?
	mini fridge
	lockable door with peephole
	boarded up window with peephole
	lightswitch
	can hide under bed or in closet (monster can hide in closet?)

main game loop idea:
	wander neighborhood to gather supplies, items and upgrades:
		supplies: food, pet food, water, lights
		items: keys, throwables
		upgrades: shoes, bags, helmets?
	items/supplies found in drawers/cabinets/hidden areas:
		can be found underneath trash/useless items (like clothing covering a hidden key)
	some houses in heighborhood locked; need to find keys to open
		some doors inside houses are also locked and need keys
	parts of neighborhood blocked by monsters:
		find correct item and/or solve puzzle to either kill/distract/sneak by monster
